What is typescript? It is a development tool to help me for type safety of my project and also it helps in collaboration so your team knows what type to use.

// to install typescript globally
npm install -g typescript

// install the typescript to the project
tsc intro.ts                                        // command - name the file
                                                    // converts intro.ts to javascript inside intro.js
